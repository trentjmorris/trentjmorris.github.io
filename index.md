# Current Projects

## [ Punch ](https://punchtimeclock.app)

Punch is a basic time clock app. Users can clock in and out, take breaks, and keep an accurate log of their hours worked. It's the very first app I released, and it used by over million people worldwide.

Available for iPhone and free to [download from the Apple App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/app/punch-time-clock/id1400078107).

## [ Logger ](https://atomic.software/logger)

Logger is the spiritual successor to Punch. Written with the latest iOS development framework, SwiftUI, Logger offers a similar workflow to Punch with added efficiency, a modern interface, and useful features:

– Log your hours worked.
– Edit entries retroactively.
– Add comments describing your accomplishments that shift.
– Estimate your paycheck.
– Take unpaid and paid breaks.
– Export timesheets as a PDF document.
– Share timesheets with an employer, client, or download for your records.
 
Available for iPhone, iPad, and Mac (Apple Silicon). [Download for free from the App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/logger-time-clock-hours-log/id1637343093?uo=4).
